# About My Project.

I found the following two programs to be textbook solutions, understood them, learned from them and created my project.

https://github.com/karlajaramillo/mars-dashboard?tab=readme-ov-file

and

https://github.com/udacity/nd032-c2-functional-programming-with-javascript-starter/tree/project/project

I found these to be exemplary solutions.
I learned a lot from them, and completed the project.
I decided that the former was a solution worthy of being adopted in the classroom.
I conclude that there is little room for modification regarding the tools.
I tried to understand each tool and adapt it to my solution.
